        <h2 id="tos">Terms of Service</h2>
        <p><strong>Last update: </strong>{{ last_update }} CET</p>
        <p><strong>Important: </strong> The enumeration (e.g. <code>i. 1</code>) can move at any time, so when citing, mentioning the date above can be really useful.</p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, you might come across labels such as <span class="ox-label">HATE</span>,
            but what do they mean? Simply put, these are abbreviation or codes to make it simpler
            to refer to specific paragraphs of the terms of service.

            <li>
                <strong>The internet is dangerous.</strong> Clicking links is at your own risk.
                The links are checked before posting of course, but the internet is dynamic and content can change.
                This rule especially applies to user generated content on social platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To err is human.</strong> All information is supplied without guarantee.
                Errors and omissions excepted.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Privacy:</strong> The website only collects necessary information about you - see below for more on that.
                Obviously, the website <i>needs</i> to store <i>some</i> data about you, often times temporarily,
                to make e.g.
                login systems work. Your personal information is not sold to advertisement companies or anything similarly
                unethical.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>User Generated Content ("Rules")</h3>
        <p>When using any ONLIX services (usually having a domain ending with <i>.onlix.me</i> and linking to this page), you agree the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <h4>General</h4>
            <li>
                Content illegal under German law is strictly prohibited! No excuses. No exceptions.
                <span class="ox-label">ILLEGAL</span>
            </li>
            <li>Instigating others to breach laws is also prohibited! <span class="ox-label">PASSIVE_ILLEGAL</span></li>
            <li>The terms of service, the license and anything else may change at any time without prior notice
                and it's your responsibility to check the website regularly for these updates.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is the obligation of users to report legal violations immediately.
                This can either be done using the report button (if present) or using <a href="/contact">the contact page</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The operator of the website can not be held liable for any legal violations caused by user the operator does
                not know of as other users are obligated to report legal violations.
            </li>
            <li>
                The website provider reserves the right to close the service or change it by
                adding or deleting features at any time. The services may also be temporarily unavailable
                at any time for technical or other reasons. 
            </li>

            <h4>In general, you are not allowed to post:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Copyrighted material or content whose license does not allow the user to distribute it. <span class="ox-label">COPYRIGHT</span></li>
                <li>Content that violates human rights <span class="ox-label">UNETHICAL</span></li>
                <li>User's private information, such as passwords and direct messages (it does not which which platform they were sent in) <span class="ox-label">LEAK</span></li>
                <li>Hateful*, racist* and violent* content <span class="ox-label">HATE</span></li>
                <li>NSFW content, such as pornographic media* and body fluids* <span class="ox-label">NSFW</span></li>
                <li>Tutorials on how to deceive, steal, scam or otherwise damage other people. This can also include malicious, non-educational, non-ethical, illegal hacking <span class="ox-label">SCAM</span></li>
                <li>Spam, affiliate-links and advertisements without the consent of the operator of the website <span class="ox-label">SPAM</span></li>
            </ol>
            
            <h5>*Exceptions:</h5>
            <p>
                These exceptions can be ignored by the website operators at any time if they feel like
                the content the user has posted is unsuitable nevertheless.
                <br>
                Additionally, illegal content is always forbidden, no matter the following exceptions.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Educational context and citation, for example news shows and similar.</li>
                <li>
                    An educational context does not persist if the user is submitting the content
                    with the intention to advertise for themselves or their company, political party,
                    association or similar. Or, simply put:
                    <strong>no propaganda</strong>.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Feel free to scan and check our systems for any kind of security vulnerabilities and other
                    types of exploits.
                    You are kindly requested (but not forced) to <a href="/contact">notify</a> the website operator before doing so.
                    <br>
                    However, the following types of attacks are strictly prohibited without permission
                    and not included in the bug bounty program:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>DDoS attacks <span class="ox-label">DDOS</span></li>
                        <li>Attacks that cause massive damage to users of the service
                            (<strong>not</strong> <i>could cause</i>, but actively <i>do cause </i>).
                            <span class="ox-label">BLACKHAT</span>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Any of these attack types can - in the worst case - get you a lawsuit.

                </li>
                <li>
                    As long as you inform us about the found vulnerabilities, you basically do not need
                    to fear legal trouble. Of course, it is strictly forbidden to sell or otherwise make
                    the vulnerabilities or the user data obtained from them available to others. <span class="ox-label">SELL_DATA</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Depending on the severity of the vulnerability, you can - if I believe you followed the rules - expect payment.
                    <br>

        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The service sometimes <i>needs</i> to store data for technical reasons.
            In this case, the operator of this website is doing their best to make it as private and secure as possible:
            personal information is usually encrypted/hashed and stored securely.

            The following exceptions describe <strong>what</strong> data is stored on <strong>which</strong> service.
            
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Sign in with XY
                </summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>WHAT: Sharing of information to 3rd parties (such as Discord) with your knowledge for account systems</li>
                    <li>REASON: To make "connect with Discord"-links work, we need to share the information which is needed to connect your account with Discord.</li>
                    <li>PAGES: Various, usually those with "Login with Discord" buttons. Examples include NovaPort.</li>
                </ul>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>
                    Entered form data/logins (user generated content)
                </summary>
                <ul>
                    <li>WHAT: Your login password is always hashed securely, in the example of
                        <a href="https://helix.onlix.me" target="_blank">HELIX</a> with the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Comparison_of_SHA_functions" target="_blank">SHA-512 algorithm</a>.
                        This is even more secure than encryption, because the operator of this website will never know your login password,
                        even if the source code would be changed, only the new passwords will be visible in plain text for anyone.
                        <br>
                        Your email address and username however has to be saved in plain text for technical reasons (how is the system supposed to display your username if it's hashed?).
                    </li>
                    <li>REASON: For the website to function properly</li>
                    <li>PAGES: Various, usually those with forms/input fields. Examples include NovaPort.</li>
                    <img src="/images/novaport-legal.png">
                </ul>
            </details>

                    <a href="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/hosting/technical-matters/what-are-session-cookies/" target="_blank">

                <ul>
