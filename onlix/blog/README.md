# If you're reading this on GitHub...
...please notice that the blog pages are meant to be visited on my website and you might encounter slight issues, such as

- `$$ path $$` instead of the actual image path
  - for example: `![Result](/$$ path $$/result.png)`
- CSS/styling problems:
  - star ratings appear as 5/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ because GitHub doesn't support inline-CSS
- no (automatic) syntax highlighting

With that being said, enjoy it nonetheless!
