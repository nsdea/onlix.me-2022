# Code your own Reddit Frontend
## Introduction

<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);">‚≠ê‚≠ê</p>

**194 lines** of code (76+21=97 Python + 97 HTML) 

**Too lazy to follow the entire tutorial or to copy everything one by one? [Here's the entire code!](https://github.com/nsdea/own-reddit-frontend)**

Maybe you've heard of alternative Reddit front-ends such as [Libreddit](https://libredd.it/). But why do they exist?

Privacy/Transparency (open source), customization (for example, you can edit the top of `style.css` file to customize themes or just simply choose one of the default ones) and simplicity (no ads, huge menus/toolbars,...).

The official Reddit frontend isn't (even though [it used to be](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit)) open source - with low hope of the *open-sourceness* of Reddit coming back. This is really sad news, but since we are programmers and the Reddit API is free to use, we can just code our own frontend!

The great thing about this project is that you can customize every aspect of it. Want to add support for a login box? Don't like the color scheme (which is actually extremely simple to do thanks to LilaCSS [[docs & repo]](https://github.com/nsde/lilacss) [[demo of themes]](https://lilacss.netlify.app/)? Want to list the comments of a post? Just take a look at the [Reddit API](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and have fun!

## Preparation

We especially need the libraries [*Flask*](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) and [*PRAW*](https://pypi.org/project/mcstatus/) (Python Reddit API Wrapper) in our project.

This project isn't quite simple, so I suggest you take a look at my tutorial on [how to build a Minecraft Serverlist](https://www.onlix.me/blog/own-minecraft-server-list) before. Even if you're not interested in doing so - it could be useful to have it opened because it's quite similar to this project.

First, we need to install a few packages. You need to have [pip installed](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/install-pip-windows) for the following commands to work. I'm going to assume that you already have a new *Python* version (I'd recommend at least 3.7 or 3.8+) and *pip* installed correctly.

So, open up your command line and enter the following commands to install the required packages:

    pip3 install praw flask Markdown python-dotenv


The command above is short for:

    pip3 install praw
    pip3 install flask
    pip3 install Markdown
    pip3 install python-dotenv

If the commands above fail, try `pip` instead of `pip3`.
The output looks like this for me:

<pre>(base) <font color="#26A269"><b>lix@on</b></font>:<font color="#12488B"><b>~</b></font>$ pip3 install praw flask Markdown python-dotenv
...
Successfully installed Markdown-3.3.6 flask-2.1.1 praw-7.5.0 python-dotenv-0.20.0
(base) <font color="#26A269"><b>lix@on</b></font>:<font color="#12488B"><b>~</b></font>$ 

</pre>

Alright, before we can actually start, we need to organize our project. Set up the following folder/file structure to get started:

    üìÇ reddit

        üìÇ static
            üìÑ style.css
        
        üìÇ templates
            üìÑ index.html
        
        üìÑ .env
        üìÑ web.py
        üìÑ reddit.py


> **Tip ¬∑** Do not name Python files by a module/library. For example, don't create a Python file called `flask.py` or `mcstatus.py`. This is because then, Python will try to import the wrong module.

> **Notice ¬∑** You might need to enable "show hidden files" in your file explorer's settings. [Here's how! (Windows 10/11)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5#WindowsVersion=Windows_11)

Again, I won't go into detail about some parts of the code which I have already explained in <a href="https://www.onlix.me/blog/own-minecraft-server-list">how to create a Minecraft server list</a>.

### API credentials

> **Warning ¬∑** Keep these credentials super secure and private! If you don't, the bot could get used by malicious people to spread malware or other illegal content!

- Create a Reddit bot app ([here's how to, you just to watch it until 4:57](https://youtu.be/3FpqXyJsd1s)) and store all needed credentials safely, for example using [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (or just copy them).

- Rename `env_template.txt` to `.env` and change its content accordingly to the values you just saved or copied.

- Make sure you copied them correctly! Double-check or view another tutorial. These pages might help: [https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api) and [https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/authentication.html](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/authentication.html)

## Python Backend (`web.py`)

    import reddit

    import flask

    app = flask.Flask(__name__, static_url_path='/')

Again (2.0), I won't go over some code here as I already explained most Flask features in my tutorial about <a href="https://www.onlix.me/blog/own-minecraft-server-list">how to create a Minecraft server list</a>.

    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        return flask.redirect('/r/tech') # don't use r/all, because it crashes... maybe you find a fix for that ;)
    
This is just the default home page which redirects the website viewer to `r/tech` by default. You can change this, of course!

    @app.route('/r/<name>')
    def r(name):
        sort = flask.request.args.get('sort') or 'hot'
        return flask.render_template('index.html', posts=reddit.posts(name, sort=sort), sub=reddit.sub(name), sort=sort)

A function for displaying a subreddit. By the way `flask.request.args` finds out what `?sort=hot` in the URL is (or for the example of YouTube: `?v=`): a [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). We need this for the buttons in the navbar for changing the mode of the sorting system (*hot*, *top* or *new*). 

    @app.route('/u/<name>')
    def u(name):
        sort = flask.request.args.get('sort') or 'hot'
        return flask.render_template('index.html', posts=reddit.posts(name, sort=sort, is_user=True), sub=reddit.user(name), sort=sort)

Same for here.

    app.run(port=1111, debug=True)

Let's move on with the module which makes it easier for use to use the Reddit API! 

## Backend helper for API (`reddit.py`)

    import os
    import praw
    import datetime
    import markdown

We'll need `os` for loading the environment variables, `PRAW` for the API wrapping, `datetime` for formatting time and `markdown` for converting markdown to HTML so we can display text correctly.

    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    load_dotenv()

The function above retrieves the data from the file `.env` and sets the environment variables accordingly.

    client = praw.Reddit(
        client_id=os.getenv('ID'),
        client_secret=os.getenv('SECRET'),
        user_agent='script',
        username=os.getenv('NAME'),
        password=os.getenv('PASS')
    )

    client.validate_on_submit = True

Initializes the API wrapper with our credentials which were set into the environment variables.

    def sub(name):
        data = client.subreddit(name)
        setattr(data, 'subscribers', f'{data.subscribers:,}') # convert to comma-separated number
        setattr(data, 'name', data.display_name)
        setattr(data, 'type_char', 'r') # r = subreddit, u = user
        setattr(data, 'description', markdown.markdown(data.description))
        
        return data

The function above is used for retrieving details about a subreddit. I set some attributes to make it easier to use within the actual API-frontend (the HTML file). Next, let's make a function for accessing information from a user on Reddit.

    def user(name):
        data = client.redditor(name)
        setattr(data, 'subscribers', f'{data.comment_karma + data.link_karma:,} Karma') # convert to comma-separated number
        setattr(data, 'type_char', 'u') # r = subreddit, u = user
        setattr(data, 'description', f'''
            {"üåü Reddit Premium" if data.is_gold else ""}
            {"‚úÖ Verified" if data.has_verified_email else ""}
            {"üëÆ Mod" if data.is_mod else ""}
            {"üîß Reddit Employee" if data.is_employee else ""}
            {"ü§ù Friends" if data.is_friend else ""}
        ''')

        return data

The goes for here, use for an user. I set "subscribers" to the user karma so we don't have to check if the frontend is displaying an user or subreddit. 

    def posts(name, sort='hot', is_user=False): # fetch posts from subreddit
        if is_user:
            sub = client.redditor(name)
        else:
            sub = client.subreddit(name)

We need to check if the post that should be displayed are from a subreddit or an user.

        posts = []

        fetch = sub.hot # default sort
        if sort == 'top': fetch = sub.top
        if sort == 'new': fetch = sub.new

This is for making the choice to switch between "hot", "top" or "new" sort available.

        for p in fetch(limit=10): # only first 10 posts, to improve speed. you can change this to a higher number if you want more posts
            setattr(p, 'time', datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(p.created_utc).strftime('%b %d %Y %H:%M')) # when the post was created

We need to convert the time from unix to a formatted string humans can actually understand properly.

            if isinstance(p, praw.models.reddit.comment.Comment):
                setattr(p, 'text', p.body_html)
                setattr(p, 'url', p.permalink)
                setattr(p, 'subreddit', p.subreddit.display_name)

Some fixes for if the post is actually a comment.

            else:
                setattr(p, 'text', markdown.markdown(p.selftext)) # convert markdown to HTML

Some Reddit description texts are saved in markdown, but we need to convert it into HTML so we can display it correctly. 

            setattr(p, 'score', f'{p.score:,}')
            setattr(p, 'num_comments', f'{p.num_comments:,}')

Self-explanatory. By the way, the `:,` adds commas for large numbers: 123456 ‚Üí 123,456

            posts.append(p)

        return posts

Alright. We're done with this file!

## HTML Frontend (`templates/index.html`)

Let's get started with our last file (we have to create for ourselves) for this project - the Jinja2 HTML template!  

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
        <title>RedditFrontend</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.8.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
        <link rel="favicon" href="/logo.png">
        <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/logo.png"/>

        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0">

    </head>
        
...Just standard HTML head stuff...

    <body class="midnight">

My CSS framework that we use (LilaCSS) has a few [pre-defined color schemes](https://lilacss.netlify.app). We just set it to "midnight". You can change it how you want to (just check out [the demo]((https://lilacss.netlify.app))), for example `"ocean night"`.

        <header class="transparent-2" style="--image: url('{{ sub.banner_img }}')">

`transparent-2` makes the subreddit banner darker so we can read the text in the foreground properly.    

            <nav>
                <a href="?sort=hot" class="{{ 'current' if sort == 'hot' else '' }}"><i class="bi bi-graph-up"></i> Hot</a>
                <a href="?sort=top" class="{{ 'current' if sort == 'top' else '' }}"><i class="bi bi-star"></i> Top</a>
                <a href="?sort=new" class="{{ 'current' if sort == 'new' else '' }}"><i class="bi bi-stars"></i> New</a>   
            </nav>
        
Adds the three buttons for choosing the sort order and redirecting the user accordingly.

            <h1>{{sub.type_char}}/{{ sub.name }}</h1>
            <details>
                <summary>Click here to show the community description.</summary>
                <p>{{ sub.description | safe }}</p>
            </details>
            <p><strong><i class="bi bi-people-fill"></i> {{ sub.subscribers }}</strong></p>
            <!-- <a href="https://reddit.com/r/{{ sub.display_name }}"><button><i class="bi bi-arrow-up-right-circle"></i> Open in normal Reddit</button></a> -->
        </header>
        
As explained in my tutorial on [how to build a Minecraft Serverlist](https://www.onlix.me/blog/own-minecraft-server-list), `| safe` allows [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/) to use actual HTML code inside of the template.

        <main>
            <div class="posts">
                {% for post in posts %}
                <div class="post">
                    {% if post.url.startswith('https://i.') %}
                    <img src="{{ post.url }}" style="{{ 'filter: blur(20px);' if post.over_18 else '' }}">

Obviously blurs media marked as "NSFW".

                    {% else %}
                    <br>
                    {% endif %}

                    <div class="content">

Next, we need to show a <mark>tag</mark> in which subreddit the post was submitted if we're on an user page.

                        {% if post.subreddit %}
                        <a href="https://reddit.com{{ post.url }}" class="plain">
                            <mark><strong>{{ post.subreddit }}</strong></mark>
                        {% else %}
                        <a href="/u/{{ post.author.name }}" class="plain">
                        {% endif %}

The following code displays the profile picture of the user that submitted the post.

                            <img src="{{ post.author.icon_img }}" style="width: 20px; border: 100%; position: relative; top: 5px;">&nbsp;
                            
And the user name as well as the date when the post was submitted:

                            <h5 style="display: inline;"><strong>u/{{ post.author.name }} ¬∑</strong> {{ post.time }}</h5>
                        </a>

These if-statements are there to display *flairs* on Reddit:

                        <h6 style="margin: 0; display: inline;">
                            {% if post.link_flair_text %}
                            <mark>{{ post.link_flair_text }}</mark>
                            {% endif %}
                            
                            {% if post.is_original_content %}
                            <mark>OC</mark>
                            {% endif %}
                            
                            {% if post.over_18 %}
                            <mark>NSFW</mark>
                            {% endif %}
                            
                            {% if post.locked %}
                            <mark>üîí</mark>
                            {% endif %}

                            {% if post.distinguished %}
                            <mark>üèÖ</mark>
                            {% endif %}
                        </h6>
                        
And the post title which redirects to the original Reddit post when clicked: 

                        <h4 onclick="window.location.href = '{{ post.url }}'">{{ post.title }}</h4>

As well as text content, converted from markdown into HTML:

                        <p>{{ post.text | safe }}</p>

Lastly, up- and downvote arrows.

                        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
                            <i class="bi bi-arrow-up vote" style="color: rgb(219, 72, 72);" onclick=""></i>
                            {{ post.score}}
                            <i class="bi bi-arrow-down vote" style="color: rgb(20, 114, 207);" onclick=""></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                            <i class="bi bi-chat-left-text"></i>
                            {{ post.num_comments }}
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>   
                {% endfor %}
            </div>
        </main>
        <footer>

You can leave an informational message in here if you want to, or links to your social media or privacy policy:

            <p>by <a href="https://www.onlix.me">ONLIX</a></p>
        </footer>
    </body>
    </html>

## Last tweaks

You can add `logo.png` in the directory `reddit/static/` if you want the website to have a little icon next to the tab. [Here's the icon I designed.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsdea/own-reddit-frontend/main/reddit/static/logo.png)

To style the website, just copy everything from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsdea/own-reddit-frontend/main/reddit/static/style.css) to `reddit/static/style.css`. If everything worked correctly, the new style should be applied now and the website should look something like this (I changed a few lines, but not too much):

## Exercises for you!

I'm done with this project, but I'd really recommend you to try master the following challenges:

- <mark>HTML</mark> <mark>CSS</mark> Use a grid layout for media.
- <mark>HTML</mark> <mark>Python</mark> Create a overview homepage with popular subreddits.
- <mark>HTML</mark> <mark>CSS</mark> <mark>Python</mark> Display a comment section upon click of the comment button. 
- <mark>HTML</mark> <mark>CSS</mark> <mark>Python</mark> <mark>JavaScript</mark> Add a login box so that the up -and downvote buttons actually work. Of course, you can also add much more, such as a feature for commenting and saving posts, posting of your own content and customizing a overview homepage with user-defined subreddits.  

You can even send me a pull request to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/nsdea/own-reddit-frontend) so I can add sample solutions!
